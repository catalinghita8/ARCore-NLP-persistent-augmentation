# ARCore-NLP-persistent-augmentation

This is a sample project that allows users to match voice commands to 3D models and load them dinamically in the augmented world. The voice command is processed using StanfordNLP and the models are obtained and loaded dynamically from Google Poly API. 
Also, with the use of Cloud Anchors, the augmentated experience is persistent thus allowing the user to add models to a 3D room and then retrieve them at any time.
